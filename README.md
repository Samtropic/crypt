# Simple NodeJs script

A minimalist Node.js TypeScript script with eslint, jest, nodemon, and prettier.
This script calls an API to tag operations based on whether the total amount of inbound and outbound transactions is balanced or not. Thus indicating that is or isn't a revenue.

## Usage

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```
